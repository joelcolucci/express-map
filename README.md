# express-map-middleware
> Write functions instead of custom middleware

Why express-map? ExpressJS features the ability to assign multiple "middleware like" callback functions to a route. This ability allows you to compose your routes as sequences of middleware rather than a single thick controller.

However this can lead to writing many small pieces of middleware or putting logic where it doesn't belong.

express-map allows you to write single purpose functions that set or transform values on Express's request and response objects.
